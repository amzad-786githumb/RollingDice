# RollingDice
 HTML code is used to design the basic structure of the project. The HTML code contains the container class that holds the player’s name and initial dice phase. 
 We have also used some CSS property to style the Dice Game.
 The JavaScript code contains the functionality of Dice Game. The first functionality is to rename the player name after clicking the button. Another functionality is to roll the dice after clicking the button. After rolling the dice by both the player, anyone player will win who get the highest phase value. If both players get the same phase value then the game will draw.
